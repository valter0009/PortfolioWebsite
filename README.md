## What's This Project?
Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ This is a **portfolio website** i made for a friend, a project I've been working on to showcase what I've learned so far while studying at IT-hÃ¶gskolan and in my free time.

## Technologies & Tools
Creating this website let me learn many new technologies. Here's a rundown:

- **Blazor**: Used for crafting the UI with C#, allowing me to use the same language for both client-side and server-side code.
- **ASP.NET Core**: The framework I chose for the server-side, seemed like a perfect choice for backend part of my app.
- **Entity Framework Core**: This ORM made it easy to interact with databases without getting bogged down in SQL.
- **Bootstrap**: Helped in making the site responsive, ensuring it works well on any device.
- **Git**: Essential for version control, allowing me to track changes and avoid commiting to mistakes in my project :)
- **Visual Studio**: My go-to IDE for writing, testing, and debugging code.
- **JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**: The backbone of web development, crucial for structuring and styling the content.
- **Authentication Services**: For secure logins and user management using  ASP.NET Core Identity and Auth0 .
- **Payment Services**: Itegrated Stripe that is handling payment processing, securely managing transactions, and ensuring a seamless checkout experience for users.
 
## Concepts Explored
Building this website was a great opportunity to learn some core web development concepts:

- **Responsive Design**: Making sure the website looks nice on all devices and does not break on mobile.
- **RESTful Services**: Creating and using APIs which allowed for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using async methods in C# for a responsive web app, I/O operations, such as database calls and API requests, without blocking the user interface.
- **Data Modeling**: Properly structuring data using Entity Framework Core and managing the project data effectively. This included defining models that represent the data entities and their relationships. Creating and managing databases.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Focusing on making the site functional and enjoyable to use.
- **Dependency Injection**: Used in ASP.NET Core for cleaner, modular code that allows the app to be more flexible to changes.

## It's a long journey
This website is very much a work in progress. It's a project where I can apply what I'm learning in real-time and experiment with new ideas. I intend to add new features as I learn.
